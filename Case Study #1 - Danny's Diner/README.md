# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

### Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

- sales
- menu
- members
